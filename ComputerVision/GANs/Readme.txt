GANs stands for Generative Adversarial Networks, is a generative deep learning model ,it can discover pattern in input data and generlize it in the outpu data, however it consist on two components, the generator that generate noises and ceate fake data (eg images) and descriminator that investigate if the data is fake or not (is a binary classifier), the descriminator guide the generator to produce good data, in other hand generator try to trick descriminator.
